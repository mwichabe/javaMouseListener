## Getting Started

Welcome to the VS Code Java world. Here is a guideline to help you get started to write Java code in Visual Studio Code.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).

# Circle Mouse Listener

This Java program allows the user to define the origin of a circle by clicking on a JPanel. It then draws the circle with the defined origin and prompts the user to click anywhere in the panel. Upon clicking, the program draws a line from the circle's origin to the clicked point and displays the distance from the origin to the clicked point, along with a message indicating whether the click was inside or outside the circle.

## Features

- User can define the origin of the circle by clicking on the panel.
- Circle is drawn with the defined origin.
- User can click anywhere in the panel, and the program draws a line from the circle's origin to the clicked point.
- Program displays the distance from the circle's origin to the clicked point.
- Program indicates whether the mouse click was inside or outside the circle.

## Getting Started

To run the program, simply compile the Main.java file and execute the compiled Main class. The program will open a window where you can interact with it using your mouse.
